                    Ever wondered about what keeps your vehicle moving? Or what prevents corrosion on the internal engine components of your car? Or how are the insides of your engine cleaned? Or what prevents the metal surfaces of the engines from wearing? Or what makes it possible for the engine to cool down? I guess not. But today, you will. The questions above have but one standard answer - Engine Oil.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You might think that delaying or skipping an oil change is no big deal when regular oil changes are critical to your engine’s health. Engine oil lubricates moving parts, prevents corrosion on internal engine components, cleans the deposit build-up inside the engine, forms a protective barrier between metal surfaces, and performs up to 40 percent of its cooling capacity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That is why, regardless of what type of vehicle you drive – a passenger car, an SUV, a light-duty pickup truck, or a family minivan – your oil change should be performed on time, every time. And if you’re from the Lynden WA area, consider yourself lucky to have come across the best in this business. Lynden Automotive Specialists provides trained auto repair experts that put customers first and execute work 100%. Visit them today at 8894 Bender Road in Lynden, Washington.

                <h2>Why should you change your oil regularly?</h2>
                <p>
                    One of the essential functions of engine oil is that it is responsible for a car’s engine lubrication, allowing it to run smoothly and last longer. One way to maintain a car’s engine is by changing the oil and using only the oil appropriate to the car’s make and model. Each vehicle comes with a “check oil” light and an oil filter under the hood. These parts allow car owners to monitor their oil levels easily and add oil as needed without hiring a professional mechanic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    More specifically, it is crucial to change oils regularly because of the following reasons:
                </p>
                <h3>BETTER GAS MILEAGE</h3>
                <p>
                    If you love or need to traverse long distances quite frequently, you get the importance of gas mileage. However, did you know that the quality of oil affects your gas mileage? Proper and consistent oil changes will help maintain excellent gas mileage. Otherwise, failing to change your oil when necessary will only reduce your gas mileage and cause you more hassle for adding up gas to your car more often. Consult a specialist now to know more, or visit Lynden Automotive Specialists if you’re in the Lynden, WA area today.
                </p>
                <h3>REDUCES ENGINE WEAR AND BUILD-UP</h3>
                <p>
                    Oil changes help remove excess dirt that can build-up in your engine. Sludge is a common development in cars that makes it difficult for engines to run efficiently, and can also be removed by oil changes. Oil changes maintain your engine’s cleanliness, and a clean engine is a smooth-running engine. If you take your vehicle to the mechanic for regular oil changes, you will only help prolong your car’s vitality. Visit Lynden Automotive Specialists if you’re in the Lynden, WA area today.
                </p>
                <h3>PROVIDE ENGINE LUBRICATION</h3>
                <p>
                    Your engine will produce a lot of heat to keep your car running smoothly and efficiently. While this is normal, improper and inconsistent oil changes run the risk of overheating. That is why it is imperative among car owners to ensure that the engine is lubricated correctly to clear the possibility of a wealth of problems. Are you having doubts about your engine’s condition? Consult an expert today at Lynden Automotive Specialists, especially if you’re in Lynden, WA.
                </p>
                <h3>LONGER ENGINE LIFE</h3>
                <p>
                    With consistent and continuous oil changes, you can help ensure extending your vehicle’s engine life. With better gas mileage, proper engine lubrication, and the prevention and removal of sludge and dirt, your engine will surely last long and be of better value. One life hack to ensure your car’s long life is by consulting professionals. Do so at Lynden Automotive Specialists located at Lynden, WA area today.
                </p>
                <h2>How long does an oil chnage take?</h2>
                <p>
                    Depending on several factors, an oil change can range from 15 minutes to a few hours. If you take your vehicle to a quick lube shop, the process may take as little as 15 minutes since oil change professionals from these shops change the oil daily. Longer time estimates typically account for waiting time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another crucial factor is the kind of vehicle you drive. Cars have oil drain plugs and filters, but not all are easily accessible. If your car’s plug is less accessible, it might be inconvenient and be more time-consuming.
                </p>
                <h2>How often should you change your oil?</h2>
                <p>
                    The previous rule of thumb was you must conduct oil changes after a 3,000-mile run mark or three months in between oil changes. However, this idea is generally outdated. While it is salient to have oil changes to keep your vehicle running smoothly and efficiently, many vehicles do well after 3,000 miles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But, it is not always the case. Some vehicles need oil changes more frequently than others. For instance, driving your vehicle at low speeds and frequently starting up your engine may warrant a need for an oil change as often as every 1,000 miles. This distinction is because vehicles that consistently run only 10 miles or below can collect condensation in the system, which breaks down the oil faster.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Conversely, several vehicles can drive up to 10,000 miles safely and efficiently. For instance, when you run synthetic oil and traverse longer distances on a relatively new vehicle, it is possible to drive up to 10,000 miles before changing your oil. However, you must use caution when deciding when to change your oil.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, it is best to consult a professional at your trusted automotive shop or if you are within the Lynden, WA area. You may consider visiting Lynden Automotive Specialists before covering this long distance without an oil change. Additionally, it is an important rule of thumb to strictly adhere to your vehicle’s drain interval necessities in your owner’s manual.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What happens when you wait too long to get an oil change?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While occasionally going beyond the recommended drain interval may not be noticeable, consistently delaying or skipping oil changes will eventually have adverse impacts. Throughout this text, we have talked about how changing engine oil helps extend your engine’s lifetime and your car in general. Continuously disregarding the need for oil changes may result in the oil becoming opaque and pitch black.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Failing to be consistent with your car’s upkeep facilitates the build-up of sludge in your engine. Over time, it can create a wealth of problems such as friction points, clog components, and can eventually result in engine seizure. While this is a worst-case scenario, it would not hurt to keep your oil new and ready to lubricate all the moving components in your engine.
                </p>
                <h2>Choosing the best oil for my car</h2>
                <p>
                    Choosing the type of oil to pick out for your vehicle is relatively easy. Your owner’s manual will indicate the specific and exact weight of oil for your vehicle. The weight of oil describes the viscosity at the ideal operating temperature of your oil. The weight of oil may be 5W-20 or 10W-30.
                </p>

                <h2>Oil Change Maintenance at Lynden WA area</h2>
                <p>
                    Customarily, you should take your car into the shop for an oil change after 3,000 to 5,000 miles. However, these can change depending on factors such as the make and the model of your ride - something your trusted mechanic can inform you. It is not new news that car owners are lazy when it comes to oil changes. Although without the immediate effect of this neglect, we would like to reiterate that failing to bring your car in for regular oil maintenance will most definitely result in damaging your vehicle in the long run.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thus, it will lead you to acquire not monetary wealth but a wealth of succeeding problems.
